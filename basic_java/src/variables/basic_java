		A local variable can be a static variable.
•	Instance variable
		A variable which is declared inside a class but outside the body of the method or constructor or block is called instance variable.
		Instance variable can be used anywhere in the program.
•	Static variable
	A variable which is declared with static keyword, inside a class but outside the body of the method or constructor or block is called static variable.
	Static variable is stored in the static memory.
	Static variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.
	Static variable can be called by class name directly.
